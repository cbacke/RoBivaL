            dcterms:description "The objective of the obstacle avoidance experiment is to demonstrate SherpaTT's ability to step over an obstacle without contact, thanks to its actively controlled suspension. For constrast, a variation of the experiment is conducted where the robot drives around the obstacle. This variation is also performed by ARTEMIS, which, due to its passive suspension, cannot step over the obstacle. Both variants are conducted only on moist and compacted soil." ;

After a successful avoidance maneuver, the robot continues in a straight line towards the finish, at the intially commanded speed." ;
